# University-Java-Assignment-2
This program reads characters from a text file where each character represents a colour e.g y equals yellow. The text file contains characters for two seperate images, one of a pond and one of a duck. The program splits these two image representations into two seperate character arrays before looping over them to display each character as a pixel where its RGB colour corresponds to the character value. Constants have been set which can alter the scale of the pond and duck when displayed. Furthermore, the duck is displayed multiple times with equal spacing and different scaling, to demonstrate use of repetition and scaling of pixel plotting.

## Installation

1. Compile the Java file using the 'javac' command from a console window.
2. Exucute the Java file using the 'java' command from a console window.

Extra: Experiment with changing the two scaling values to see how the image formed on the graphics window changes (POND_SCALE and DUCK_SCALE).
